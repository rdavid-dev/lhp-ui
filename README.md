## LHP UI
This is the Single Page Application for the challenge, and for this I used Vite config and Composition API for the structure.

NOTE: This project doesn't need docker to run

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS

## Steps to run this project
- Clone this project anywhere on your machine
- Go to the folder `cd lhp-ui`
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- Check your .env file and make sure your API is pointed on the correct url which is `localhost:5010`

## NOTE
UX are simplified on this project, so other I didn't use any packages such as.
- VueSweetLoader
- ProgressSpinnner
- VeeValidate
